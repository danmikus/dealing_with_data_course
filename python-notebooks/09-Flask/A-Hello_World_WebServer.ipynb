    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a **micro web framework** written in Python and based on the [Werkzeug toolkit](werkzeug.pocoo.org/) and [Jinja2 template engine](jinja.pocoo.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.\n",
